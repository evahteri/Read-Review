# Read Review

 Read Review is a website to write and publish reviews of books and read other users' reviews of books.
 The app is hosted on heroku at https://tsoha-read-review.herokuapp.com/
 App can be tested using any browser but I recommend using chrome as the app is developed using chrome as a test environment.
 The app is usable on most mobile devices.
